  <div id="myDiv">
    This text will be hidden.
  </div>
  <script>
    // Incorrectly hiding an element using display: none in the style attribute
    document.getElementById("myDiv").style.display = "none";
    //The error is caused by trying to access an element's style property before the element has been fully parsed into the DOM.
    //The correct approach is to use the addEventListener to ensure that the script runs after the DOMContentLoaded event.
  </script>
